# Roblox Limited Sniper & Analyzer

RoboLimited is a trading algorithm that buys and sells undervalued Roblox virtual items using Rolimons and the Roblox API. It automates trades, snipes deals, and analyzes price trends using custom functions that weigh demand and pricing against recent sales activity. While designed for digital collectibles, the methodology maps to broader financial technology systems such as market monitoring and algorithmic trading.

### üí° Inspiration ###
Roblox, while best known as a gaming platform for kids, also hosts one of the largest marketplaces for collectible virtual items, known as Limiteds, which function in many ways like NFTs. Growing up, Roblox was a part of my childhood, so many years later, I'm using its marketplace as the foundation for this project. The limited market space offers the perfect opportunity to practice building an efficient algorithmic trading system within a real, dynamic online economy.

On the platform, players buy and trade limited accessories with each other, creating price fluctuations and intrinsic value much like shares of stock. Market activity revolves around several key metrics:
- RAP (Recent Average Price): historical average based on recent trades.
- Value: an adjusted Robux value, often set by third-party aggregators like Rolimons.
- Best Price: the current lowest resale price available on the market.

Market participants use these indicators to infer a limited's worth and make a profit by getting their hands on them before everyone else catches on. This Go application implements a low-latency acquisition and trading pipeline that detects underpriced listings, completes purchases quickly, and manages subsequent trades for profit.
